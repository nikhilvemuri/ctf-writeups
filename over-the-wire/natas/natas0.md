## Natas 0 ##

Natas is a wargame based on **web server security** challenges.
Visit [overthewire.org/wargames/natas](overthewire.org/wargames/natas) to get started.

These are my write-ups for each challenge. I will not be sharing the passwords for any level after this one, rather just the steps I took to get each one. 

Once inside level 0 (use the password given on the starter page), we can inspect the source code of the landing page to find the password for level 1 commented inside the `body` of the HTML source. On to level 1.
