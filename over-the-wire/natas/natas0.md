## Natas 0

Natas is a wargame based on **web server security** challenges.
Visit http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas to get started.

These are my write-ups for each challenge. I'll be going through the steps to get each password.

Once inside level 0 (use the password given on the starter page), we can inspect the source code of the landing page to find the password for level 1 commented inside the `body` of the HTML source. On to level 1.

password1: `gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto`
