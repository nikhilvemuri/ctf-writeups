## Off-Topic (misc, 5)

**Description**:

"#off-topic"

This looks like a Discord channel name. Sure enough, in the header of the
off-topic channel, we see "who here knows the name of the catpanda in the
server picture? will give points if you know".

This took a bit of searching, but inspecting around the website finally led
me to the logo picture on the homepage, which upon inspecting showed the
alt-text "Jubie".

`rtcp{Jubie}`
