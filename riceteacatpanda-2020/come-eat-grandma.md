## Come Eat Grandma (general skills, 25)

**Description**: 

Oh, my bad, this spreadsheet appears to be missing its commas.

---

We're given the link to a spreadsheet which has open edit access. The flag
must be somewhere here, but people have written all kinds of nonsense all
over the sheet. 

There's a "Version History" option in the File tab, but it's greyed out.
Logging in with a Google account gives us access to version history, and
looking back to the original, unmodified sheet gives us the flag.

`rtcp{D0n't_E^t_Gr4NDmA_734252}`
