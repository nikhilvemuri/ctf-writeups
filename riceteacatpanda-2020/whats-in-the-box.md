## What's in The Box?! (web, 200)

**Description**: 

No text, but there's a tiny image of a box which is linked
to something.

---

Clicking on the box spawns an animated kitten emoticon which roams around
the page randomly.

Looking more closely, the link is actually just one huge line of JS code. Dragged it
to the bookmarks toolbar and copied the entire link from there into a text
editor. 

Searching for "rtcp" actually pointed me to a comment with a fragment of
the flag. Piecing together the remaining fragments gives us the flag.

`rtcp{k4wA1I_kitT3nz_4_tH3_w1N!!_41232345}`
