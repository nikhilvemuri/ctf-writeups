## Don't Give The GIANt a COOKie (crypto, 100)

**Description**:

It was just a typical day in the bakery for Delphine. She was preparing her famous chocolate cake, when all of a sudden a GIANt burst through the doors of her establishment and demanded a cookie. Being the strong-willed girl she was, Delphine refused and promptly threw her rolling pin at the GIANt. Doing what any sensible being would do when faced with projectiles, the GIANt let out a shriek and ran out of the shop. Delphine smiled to herself, it was another day well done.

But oh? What's this? It seems the GIANt dropped this behind while he was screaming and scrambling out of the shop.

Story was amusing, but the string dropped by the giant looks a lot like a
hash value. Specifically, like an MD5 hash value, based on the size and the
fact that MD5 has been found to be vulnerable to collisions.

Putting the value through an MD5 cracker gives us "chocolate mmm". In the
flag format, this gives us:

`rtcp{chcolate_mmm}`
