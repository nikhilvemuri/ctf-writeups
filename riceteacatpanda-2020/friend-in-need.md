## A Friend In Need Is A Friend Indeed (misc, 50)

**Description**:

Hm, I see a lot of potential friends in the midst of that discord, but... one is not like the others; maybe I'll slide into their dms and strike up a conversation about passwords!

---

The sanity check challenge is named Strong Password. That flag was
`rtcp{rice_tea_cat_panda}`.

Assuming that flag is the password, we go to Discord.

Jade, one of the Discord bots in the server, gives us the flag when we give her the "Strong Password" flag.

`rtcp{awaken_winged_sun_dragon_of_ra}`
