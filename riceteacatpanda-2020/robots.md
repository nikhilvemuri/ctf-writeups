## Robots. Yeah, I know, pretty obvious. (web, 25) 

**Description**: 

So, we know that Delphine is a cook. A wonderful one, at that. But did you know that GIANt used to make robots? Yeah, GIANt robots.

Title was pretty straightforward: putting /robots.txt after the RTCP
homepage URL gives us a robots page which points to 2 hidden directories:
/robot-nurses and /flag. 

I had a hunch that /flag was going to be a meme, so I went to /robot-nurses
first and did end up finding the flag there. /flag had an embedded YouTube
video of Never Gonna Give You Up, which made me equally happy.
