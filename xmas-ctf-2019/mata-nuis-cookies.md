## Mata Nui's Cookies (crypto)

The given file, chall.png, shows a series of symbols, and we are told that
"Mata Nui said something about his beloved cookies, but I've never seen
this language before." 

Mata Nui sounded familiar - a Google search revealed that he's a character
from the Bionicle universe, and he speaks the Matoran language. A Matoran
to English decoder gives us the flag: `X-MAS{MATANUIHASPREPAREDTHECOOKIES}`
